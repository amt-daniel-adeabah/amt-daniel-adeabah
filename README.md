Hey! I'm Daniel. 

Coding has changed my world. It's not just about apps. Learning to code gave me problem-solving skills and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job. And I learned it all at SoloLearn, CodeAcademy, FreeCodeCamp, w3schools, IPMC, AmaliTech gGmbHâ€¦ where they build your self-esteem and keep you motivated. 

Join me in this rewarding journey. You'll have fun, get help, and learn along the way!
