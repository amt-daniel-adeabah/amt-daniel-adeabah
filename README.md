Hello! I'm Daniel. 

Coding has altered my entire universe. Not all of it is about apps. My ability to communicate technically with people and develop problem-solving skills came from learning to code. Additionally, I can create websites and use my coding expertise to advance in my career. And I acquired all of this knowledge at places like IPMC, CodeAcademy, FreeCodeCamp, w3schools, SoloLearn, and AmaliTech gGmbH, where they boost your motivation and self-esteem. 


Join me on this worthwhile adventure. Along the way, you'll have fun, get assistance, and learn.
